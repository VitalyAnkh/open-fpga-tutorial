# Preface

This book is an adapted version of the [open-fpga-verilog-tutorial](https://github.com/Obijuan/open-fpga-verilog-tutorial) by [Juan Gonzalez-Gomez](https://github.com/Obijuan). The original tutorial is a great resource for learning Verilog and programming FPGA. However, it is written in Spanish and is not easily accessible to non-Spanish speakers. This book is an attempt to make the tutorial more accessible to a wider audience.

Features:

- Spanish -> English
- GitHub Wiki -> book website (using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)
- Toolchains updates: the original tutorial was written in 2014, and the toolchains have changed a lot since then: the [arachne-pnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/arachne-pnr) is discontinued, which has been replaced by [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr);
